# Project 1 (Graded Assignment)

Some problems I faced:
> I couldn't figure out how to add a margin between the boxes as it kept messing up the layout thats why they are sticked together.<br>
        
Would be great if someone can recitify my mistakes and get back to me.<br>

*EDIT*
> Added position : relative to the box and it worked.
